# Books
Coming from an engineering background, I have always hated reading textbooks. Most of the textbooks were dry and the presented topics were not interesting in any way. But over the course, in my career I have found very interesting books which made me think in completely new direction.

As you get updated with latest technology news, it's very important to read books because books distill the best practices of craft and gives in depth understanding of the topics.

The books presented are here like stepping stone to the interesting and fun programming books. After reading few of these, I hope you are interested to read more books which again will help you to read more.

#What kind of books you should read?

Try to avoid the books which teaches you just syntax and semantics of a programming language. Though, syntax and semantics are important for programming they may not be helpful in the longer run. So I have avoided those kind of books and have given set of books that goes deeper into the programming.

You can get hard copy and e-books of these from amazon. If you try hard you should be able to get downloadable pdf too.

#Programming Books to start with

* ###[Coders at Work](http://www.codersatwork.com/)

In every department of engineering, people learn about great people who have contributed to the field. In music, every one will learn about Beethoven, Tyagaraj. Sadly in our field, we hardly know about the those people. So let's start our reading list by knowing the great people in our field and understanding their contribution to computer science.

**Coder's at Work** is a collection of interviews with Great programmers from various sections of computer science. Going through these interviews will make you familiar with how people learn programming and how they contributed overtime. It gives you inspiration to become just more than a programmer.

* ###[The C Programming language](http://www.amazon.com/The-Programming-Language-2nd-Edition/dp/0131103628)
