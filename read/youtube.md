#Youtube course vs MOOC 

Unlike MOOC courses, youtube courses do not have any hands on or instructor feedback. They are just recorded sessions inside the college/institution. Though MOOC courses are superior than the youtube one's, not every course is offered in MOOC format yet. So stick with Youtube courses till those courses come in MOOC format.


#Conference talks
Every year, across the  world many computer science conferences are conducted. It's almost impossible to attend all of those conferences but don't worry most of the videos of these conferences are available on Youtube.

Conference talks are best way to learn the state of art technology from the best in field. Over the years many great videos have changed the way I think about  computing and programming. Such talks are highly useful to improve your skills. 

Following are the few talks to start with
