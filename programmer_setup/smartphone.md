# Smartphone
These days everyone owns a phone. Most of the those phones are touch screen based phones, called Smart phones. You may own or used one of those smartphone. Though most of the times people use their phones just to make calls, messaging or play games you can do more as developer. In this section we are going to discuss how owning a smartphone can improve you as a developer and add a new dimension to you knowledge and productivity.


#What is a smartphone?
Smartphone is a hand held computer which is  normally operated using touchscreen interface. They are essentially limited version of desktop or laptop. They run operating systems that are created from basis of computer operating system.

#Android vs iOS

Android and iOS two most famous smartphone operating system in market now. You may be wondering which phone you should get! Is it iPhone running iOS or phones running Android OS. Both phones have similar user facing characteristics but they have different level of control for developer.

iOS is based on  Mac operating system developed by Apple and Android is based on Linux operating system. As we discussed in earlier chapter, Linux is a viable operating system in Desktop for a developer and its same for phone too. So if you want to tinker with phone like you do with your computer, I recommend you to go with Android.

#Why Android ?
The following are few reasons you should pickup Android as you smartphone.

* ###Linux based

    Android is based on linux. It follows similar conventions for file system, process management etc like Ubuntu or any other linux based computer operating system. So its like you carrying linux system with you.

* ### Open source

  Android is open source. This means you can look at the code and try to learn how a mobile operating system works. Not only you can poke around code, if you feel adventurous you can create your custom operating system from this source code like thousands of other developer does. One of most famous custom ROM is [Cynogenmod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/). Here thousands of developers collaborate and create their own version of Android flavor. You can join them too.

* ### Apps

One of the great things about the Smartphone they come with lot of great applications. It's also true in Android. You great apps on phone. Some of must have apps are

* [Feedly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly) - Now you can read news where you are
* [Pocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro) - Read it later on phone
* [Calendar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar) - Keep track of all your appointments
* [Google Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep) - Todo app


If you see the apps mentioned above, all the apps are highly useful to keep track of news and work right on the phone. They sync seamless on web so you don't have put info in multiple times.

* ### Java based Application development

Using apps developed by others is good. But how about writing your own App? that's going to be awesome. One of the good thing about Android is it uses standard language like Java and tools like Eclipse, Idea for mobile application development. Most of these tools you already know from previous sections, which means you already capable of building apps for your phone.

#Which Android phone to Buy?

Now you know the value of owning a Android smartphone, you may be wondering what phone you should buy. People consider lot of things when they buy phone right from price to camera quality. So the recommendation here done only on developer friendliness. Normally I want to buy an Android phone which

* Runs stock Android
* Should be update to newer OS
* Should support custom ROM like Cynogenmod
* Easy to customize both in OS and apps
* Good developer community support

As you see I have no say on hardware features and price range. That's all is up to you to decide . But if you want to own a great developer friendly phone I recommend you [Google Nexus](http://www.google.com/nexus/) series phones.
