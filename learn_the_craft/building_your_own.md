# Building your own

The last chapter talked about building complete computer system. Though its a powerful course to teach you most of the pieces,but you still cannot use the softwares are built in real world.

So this section I am going to discuss about the softwares that are used on daily basis. Here you are going to create few of the software that you use everyday like Operating system, compiler etc.. and get a feel as how these things are built from scratch!.

#Why build when it already exist

Most of the students want to build new shiny things. It's easy to understand the urge to create something that no one has ever created. But before that, is it not good to understand things that we use every day?. So by building your own version of such tools makes you understand those tools intimately and since you use those tools everyday you are comfortable enough to start with.


#Use what you create
People ask me how to improve their code quality. I say use what you create. It's the best way to improve. So the idea create your own language,compiler is not only for learning, you can use those tools as your daily driver. That makes you understand how much hard it is to create a quality software and why you should make your code more readable.
