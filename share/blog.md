# Blog

Writing blog is like keeping a dairy. Blog allows you to keep track of things that you do and share it with world. A good blog not only helps author, it also helps readers to improve their knowledge. Writing blogs seems to be easy in first sight, but when you do its not that easy.

#Writing is hard
Writing is a different art compared to talking. Talking comes natural to humans but not writing. Writing is something we have cultivated as a culture. So when I ask some developer to talk about what they are doing, they can happily  talk for hours. But if I ask developer to write down what they did, they will have hard time doing it. This is one of the main reason for not having documenation for most of software tools.

Writing needs a focused manner of expressing your understanding to fellow person. A good blog always wins its audience by its simplicity and precise explanation to the point. So writing not only keeps track of your work, but also teaches you how to express your understanding in a better way.

#Writing as communication tool at workplace
In any job, writing is a primary communication skill. You have to write documents to express your ideas to your clients. You have to write mails to express your ideas to higher management. So if anything helps you to improve writing skills better you should start doing it. Blogging is one of the best way to do that.
