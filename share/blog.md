# Blog

A good blog not only helps author, it also helps it's readers to improve their knowledge. Writing a blog seems to be easy in first sight, but when you do its not that easy.

#Writing is hard
Writing is different than talking. Talking comes natural to humans but not writing. Writing is something we have cultivated as a culture thing. So when I ask some developer to talk about what they are doing, they can happily  talk for hours. But if I ask them to write down what they did, they have hard time doing it. This is  one of the main reasons why often documentation of most of software tools is not available.

Writing needs a focused manner of expressing your understanding to a fellow person. A good blog always wins over its audience by its simplicity and to the point explanation. So writing not only keeps track of  your work, it also allows you to express your understanding in clean manner.

#Writing as communication tool at workplace

So if anything helps you to improve your writing skill you must always do it. Blogging is one of the best tool to do that.
